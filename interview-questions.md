# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: Parameters are like names and arguements are the values passed in. So for example a parameter would be something like (name) but the arguement, the actual value would be my name, "Zeke".

Researched answer: A parameter is a variable we name that is then passed into a function. They are used to pass arguements into a function. The arguement has the actual values in it. Arguements are used to get to the parameter. 

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: .map is told to iterate through the whole array or string. It can also be told to manipulate each index for example multiply all the numbers by 2, and it will return all the numbers back multiplied by 2. 

Researched answer: .map will create a new array and it calls each element once in an array. 

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: .map will not change the length of an array but .filter will give you back a modified shorter array. .filter will take an arguement and if that element does not meet the requirement of the arguement, it will not be returned to us. 

Researched answer: .filter will return a boolean value to make a decision if the element met the criteria or not. .map will make a new array but it will still keep the same length. 

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is when something loops usually multiple times. You can iterate through an array multiple times until a condition is met for example. 

Researched answer: Iteration is performing a certain action multiple times, usually you dictate how many times, until a condition is met. We use iteration to perform many tasks. It will only stop when the condition is false. 

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: A class is the blueprint of an object. For example you can have a car as an object but the class will determine if its a german car, how many cylinders, is it electric and all these other details. An object has key:value pairs in them. For example an object will be a car. 

Researched answer: Objects have data in them in the form of key:value pairs. The data inside them determines different characteristics about the object. Like car is the object and color:red would indicate the car is red. With a class you will have objects inside them. You can also make new objects in a class but overall the object will be in the same class. 

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: I am not sure but I can definitely do some research and come back with an answer. 

Researched answer:Hoisting is using a variable before it has been declared. It is moving the declarations to the top of the scope. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. User stories: It is to get a description of a feature from a user's perspective. It can describe the type of user, what they could want and why they would want the feature they want. It is to see how a end user thinks of a feature and if they like it or not. 

2. Spread operator: ... makes it so you can dynamically use data instead of calling directly on it. For example ...arr will understand we want to call upon everthing in the array and we can dynamically call upon it

3. React: It is a JS library for making apps or web pages. You can make many little components and bring them together to create a whole app. It was created by Facebook.

4. React props: Special React objects that are utilized to move information from one component to another one. They can be unidirectional in behavior.

5. DOM events: allow JS to have different event handlers and work in tandum with functions. Functions will not be executed until the event happens. For example clicking a button.
